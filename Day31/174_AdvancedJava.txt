1 Json Object 
	- java Script Object Notation
	- It is light weight Object 
	- It kept data into key & value format 
	synatx 
	{
		id:9,
		fname:"sumit",
		lname:"Raokhande"
	}
	For postman S/w or Tool 
		{
			"id":"9",
			"fname":"sumit",
			"lname":"Raokhande"
		}
		
	{
		"id":"9",
		"fname":"Sumit",
		"country":{
			"cid":"1",
			"cname":"India"
		}
	}
		
2 Array of Object
	
	[
		{
			"id":"9",
			"fname":"sumit",
			"lname":"Raokhande"
		},
		{
			"id":"6",
			"fname":"Kiran",
			"lname":"Raokhande"
		},
		{
			"id":"3",
			"fname":"Spruha",
			"lname":"Raokhande"
		}
	]
	

3 Rest Vs Soap
	+ REST 
		- Typically REST works on top of HTTP protocol
		- Can be accessed from any device which has internet connection.
		- REST is lightweight (than SOAP)
			- gives freedom -- XML or JSON -- JSON is preferred.
			- JSON processing is lighter.
			- JSON needs less data

	+ SOAP 
		- SOAP services gives XML data 
		- Can be accessed & processing XML data needs more device config.
			- XML processing is heavy
			- XML needs more data=> It required more memory consumption

4 Difference between Spring & Spring Boot
	Spring 
 1 Spring is Freamwork
 2 You have to create explicitly IOC Container
 3 If you work with mvc or REST API then you need to configure tomcat server by yourself.
 
Spring Boot
1 It is  tool which makes the work easier to create ready to run application.
2 IOC Container is create automatically we don't required to create explicitly.
3 Where as in Spring Boot it is embedded tomact server in it. It is making your life easier.


5 Http Request & Http Response
	Http Request => 2 parts 
	1 Http header 
		Req Method = GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
			Uri = resource identifier
			HTTP version =  1.1
			Browser language = en
			Client/Browser = IP address
			Content Type = type of data
				text
					text/plain, text/xml, "text/html"
				image
					image/jpeg, image/png, ...
				audio
					audio/mp3, audio/wav, ...
				video
					video/mpeg, ...
				application
					application/json, application/pdf, ...
					
			Content Length = num of bytes in body
			Cookies
			User-Agent = Browser details
	
	2 Http body 
		data 
				e.g. form data -- in key=value pair.
				e.g. JSON data,html,xml(outdated) 

Http Response
	Headers:
			HTTP version=1.0/1.1
			Content-Type= type of data in resp body.
			Content-Length= num of bytes in resp body.
			Status code & message
			
				HTTP Status code:
					1 2xx=> 200-299 --> success e.g. 200 (success/OK)
					2 3xx 300-399 --> redirection e.g. 302 (http redirection)resource move to other
					3 4xx  400-499 --> client side errors e.g. 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 400 (Bad Request) ...	
					4 5xx 500-599 --> server errors Whenever there is problem on server side this series is used			
			
			
			Server info= IP address
			Cookies
		Body:
			data
				e.g. HTML tags
				e.g. JSON data
6 Http Methods 
	1 get => to fetch a data from backend server 
	2 post => to send data from frontend server to backend server 
	3 put =>  to update a particular record 
	4 delete => to delete a particular record
